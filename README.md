# CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript
### Project 1: Wikipedia-like Online Encyclopedia
This is my first Django project where I familiarized myself with Django's basic features, including the relationship 
between different files and class-based form handling.
Credit for the pre-created CSS styling and functions in encyclopedia/util.py goes entirely to the CS50 staff.
